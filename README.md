## ✨ Key Technical Highlights & Features

As a backend-focused developer, I tackled a mix of foundational architecture design and real-world cloud engineering challenges in this project:

* **🔥 C# Fundamentals & RESTful API Design:** Built a clean, standard REST API using **ASP.NET Core**. Utilized **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** to strictly separate internal database models from external API contracts. Configured the HTTP request pipeline using **Middleware** and implemented **Dependency Injection (DI)** to maintain loose coupling across controllers and services. Heavily relied on **Asynchronous Programming (`async/await`)** to ensure non-blocking database operations.
* **🔐 Authentication & Security:** Engineered a secure login system utilizing **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to protect Admin-only endpoints. Implemented best practices for credential management using `.NET User Secrets` locally and **Azure Environment Variables** in production to completely isolate database connection strings and secret keys.
* **🗄️ Relational Data Modeling (Azure SQL & EF Core):** Engineered a highly normalized database schema utilizing **Entity Framework Core (Code-First approach)**. Managed complex entity relationships across `Users`, `FoodItems`, `Orders`, and `OrderItems` (acting as a junction table to resolve many-to-many relationships). Wrote efficient **LINQ** queries to aggregate accurate business metrics, such as calculating total revenue by dynamically filtering out "Cancelled" orders.
* **☁️ Cloud-Native Deployment & Networking:** Successfully deployed the API to **Microsoft Azure App Service**. Tackled real-world networking issues by configuring strict **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** policies, ensuring the API securely accepts HTTP requests only from the authorized Vercel-hosted frontend domain.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Database

The system architecture follows a clean, decoupled design pattern, ensuring separation of concerns between API routing, business logic, and data access.

**Core Database Entities:**
* `User`: Handles Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), distinguishing between `Admin` and standard `Customer` privileges.
* `FoodItem`: Represents the restaurant's menu catalog, storing essential details like name, description, price, and image URLs.
* `Order`: Tracks the high-level order lifecycle (`Pending` -> `InProgress` -> `Delivered` / `Cancelled`) and aggregates the total transaction amount.
* `OrderItem`: Acts as a crucial **Junction Table** resolving the many-to-many relationship between `Order` and `FoodItem`. It captures the historical price and quantity at the exact time of purchase, ensuring data integrity even if menu prices change later.
